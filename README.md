# Wheels On Demand
## Description

MERN Stack Application, a rental platform that allows users to book cars. This is a ongoing project and is by no chance complete ðŸ˜…. The site, does however, fully work. The login and jwt are in the project but just commented out. I will be updating the website and making it better over time. It is a learning process for me and I hope to make it a fully functional website one day.
